# Automatic Grow Tunnel
This Project is to demonstrate a A-Z DIY build of a green house. The goal of this project is to
1. Buy The electrical components, including wires, PCB boards , breakers.
2. Buy components to make a IP66/67 complient setup. A IP67 complient setup is a must in a greenhouse environment.
3. Buy a water pump and solinoid valves which are controlled by the electrical components.
4. Buy a grow tunnel, water pipes, sprinklers and 
5. Make a electrical diagram which shows the electrical wiring using the easyda.com free online tool for diagrams.
6. Make a 3D cad model of the setup to show the dimensions of the different components are correct.
7. Build the solution.
8. Program the the computer chip with RUST to control the watering based on input sensors and stream the data with wifi to the house.
